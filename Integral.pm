  use Chatbot::Integral;
  blah blah blah

=head1 ABSTRACT

  This should be the abstract for Chatbot::Integral.

  If you don't want an ABSTRACT you should also edit Makefile.PL to
  remove the ABSTRACT_FROM option.

=head1 DESCRIPTION

Stub documentation for Chatbot::Integral, created by h2xs. It looks like the
author of the extension was negligent enough to leave the stub
unedited.

Blah blah blah.

=head2 EXPORT

None by default.
